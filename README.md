# Gemstones-algo
This code solves the Gemstones problem by finding minerals common to all rocks in a collection. It starts with the first rock's minerals and progressively intersects them with each subsequent rock's composition. The final count represents gemstones present in every rock, determined through successive set intersection operations.
